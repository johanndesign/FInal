            <p>I discovered my passion for design when I was a freshman in High School; It was then when it became clear what I wanted to do for a living. I'm pursuing my career at Borough of Manhattan Community College where I'm studing my major in Multimedia Programming.
                <br>
                <br>I’m constantly learning web technologies and other design related topics, currently playing around with Javascript and JQuery. I’m a skilled in many areas of design and development.
                <br>
                <br>My Design process always starts with a pencil and paper, scribbling ideas and concepts, thinking about the problem and the solution.
                <br> Once I have an idea of what I want to achieve, I’ll then sit down at my computer and start with wire frames and low level mockups. Then add the imagery, typography design and details.
                <br> One of the things I love about my Job, is the great tools I get to work with every day, here are some of the tools I use in my work.</p>
